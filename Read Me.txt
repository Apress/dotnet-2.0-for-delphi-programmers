3863.Code.zip contains the sample code for my book

	.NET 2.0 for Delphi Programmers
	
(Apress, 2006) ISBN 1590593863 - <http://www.midnightbeach.com/.net>.
Most of the projects are just little snippets that illustrate a single
point but some of them are more substantial, and contain code that you
might want to use in your own projects.

You can freely use, modify, and distribute this source code PROVIDED 
that you keep the copyright and contact info in every file you use.

To install the sample code, just extract all the files to some directory
like "My Documents\Shemitz" - this creates a 'local root' directory. When
the book refers you to a project like the "Chapter11\RegexExplorer C# 
project", you will find it in the Chapter11\RegexExplorer subdirectory of
the directory that you extracted the files to.

All the projects should compile, and all the executables should run -
though some do require you to create data files by running other projects
first. (Note that most of the C# projects require Visual Studio 2005, and
can't be loaded in .NET 1.x environments.) If you run into any problems, 
please feel free to contact me at mailto:jon@midnightbeach.com.

I'm always glad to hear my readers' compliments, questions, and even 
criticisms. Of course, I'm especially glad to hear offers of work - I make
a living by programming, consulting, and training. For more information
